            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a senior finance leader with over 19 years of experience driving commercial finance, operational transformation, and strategic planning across India, West Asia, and APAC. My journey spans global firms like CBRE, JLL, and Johnson Controls, and my work has spanned corporate real estate, banking, and high-growth services sectors. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Across every role, I’ve focused on connecting finance to the bigger business picture — managing portfolios of ₹100Cr to ₹200Cr+, influencing capital investments of ₹400Cr+, and leading cost-saving and compliance initiatives that delivered ₹50Cr+ in measurable value. I’ve worked closely with cross-border leadership teams, built finance and ops functions from the ground up, and led teams of over 100 people through complex transformations.
            </p>
            <p>
                My strength lies in creating clarity and control in fast-moving environments — building smart financial systems, tightening operations, and aligning numbers to outcomes. Whether it’s month-end close, vendor negotiations, budget strategy, or board-level decision support — I bring a hands-on, business-first mindset to the table.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m currently exploring full-time leadership roles — Director, VP, CFO — and also open to consulting, advisory, or project-based opportunities where I can drive lasting financial and operational impact.
